# Pointers

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of an object. Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation and data structures like linked lists and trees. Use `*` to declare and dereference pointers, and `&` to get the address of a variable.

# References

A reference is an alias for another variable. Changes to the original variable are reflected in the reference. References are often used in function parameters to avoid copying large amounts of data.

# Classes

Classes are user-defined types that represent objects with attributes and methods. Use access specifiers like `private` and `public` to control access to members. Constructors initialize objects, and methods define their behavior.

# Pointers and Classes

Pointers can be used to dynamically allocate objects of a class. Use `new` to allocate memory and `delete` to free it. Access members of the object using the `->` operator.

# Examples

Examples include basic pointer usage, references, and classes with pointers. They demonstrate how changes to variables affect pointers, references, and independent copies.
